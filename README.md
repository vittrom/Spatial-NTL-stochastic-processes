# qp-template
Project directory and LaTeX template for UBC STAT 548 Qualifying Paper reports

## Instructions for use:
1. Download this repository (cloning is unnecessary).
1. Move to an appropriate place on your machine, unzip, and rename from `qp-template` to `qp-yourgivenname-yoursurname` (please replace with your names, and please leave in all lowercase).
1. If necessary, [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
1. [Initialize](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) as a git repository and make an [initial commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).
1. [Add the project to GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).
1. At some point before you submit the report, [add me as a collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
1. Use the directory structure to keep your project organized and use the LaTeX template in the `doc/report` directory for your report. See below for more details on using the LaTeX template. See [my website](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~benbr/assets/courses/stat548-19-20.pdf) for details on my expectations for the report.
1. Commit and push your changes regularly. It serves as a back-up and lets me see how you progressed.
1. When you are ready to submit your report, commit with the message "submission for BBR review".
1. Send me an email confirming that you have submitted your report for review and marking.


## Details on directory usage
The short version: Each subdirectory has its own README file that tells you what goes in the directory.

The long(er) version: 
* Use the `doc` directory to for all written portions of the project. Writing in `reading_log.md` and `project_log.md` are not required, but I have found that keeping them up-to-date is helpful for research. For the purposes of the QP, keeping these up-to-date also lets me see how you progressed through the project.
* Use `ref/qp-bib.bib` to keep your biliography up-to-date, and use it as the bib-file for your report. Feel free to keep PDFs of relevant papers here; `.gitignore` won't upload them to GitHub.
* Use `src` for any code you develop and `dat` for any data you use (including output from your code). (There may be good reasons for not keeping your code in the same repository as your report, in which case let me know and invite me as a collaborator to that repo, as well.)
* Use `aux` for anything else.

## Details on LaTeX template usage
* Compile `main.tex`, but make minimal edits. Most edits should be made in the compontent tex-files in the `sections/` directory.
* `header.tex` loads packages, tweaks formatting, etc. Edit as necessary, but do not change document formatting.
* `defs.tex` defines notation, custom commands, etc. Edit freely.
* Graphics go in `fig`.
* `cleanup.sh` cleans up auxiliary files, etc., in case your directory looks cluttered. Use is not required.
