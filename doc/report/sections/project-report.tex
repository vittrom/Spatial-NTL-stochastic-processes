\section{Project report}\label{project_report}

In this section we follow the analysis of \cite{james2006poisson} to derive a posterior distribution for the SPNTL process. In \Cref{NTL_definition} we give a rigorous definition of a NTL process and derive a formula of the random distribution function in terms of a stochastic process, similarly to Thm. 3.1 of \cite{doksum1974tailfree}. \Cref{CBM} introduces the cumulative birth measure, the random measure we will use to specify a SPNTL process. \Cref{SPNTL_process} outlines the SPNTL process and in \Cref{SPNTL_posterior} we detail the posterior analysis and derive the main result of the paper using results from Poisson partition calculus \cite{james2005poisson,james2006poisson}.

\subsection{Neutral to the left stochastic process}\label{NTL_definition}
The Bayesian analysis of SPNTL is based on NTL stochastic processes. \cite{doksum1974tailfree} provides a framework to analyse NTR processes and characterize the random distribution function in terms of a Levy process. The NTR characterization, as well as the relation between the random distribution function and a Levy process is essential to obtain the results in \cite{james2006poisson}. Therefore, we give here a similar characterization for NTL processes as this will aid the posterior analysis of SPNTL.

Given a sequence of random variables $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_k)$, we say that $X$ is NTL if the increments form a sequence, $R$, of mutually independent random variables in $[0, 1]$ \cite{bloem2018sampling}, that is

\begin{equation*}
R = \left(1, \frac{X_2}{X_1 + X_2}, \ldots, \frac{X_j}{\sum_{i=1}^j X_i}, \ldots, \frac{X_k}{\sum_{i=1}^k X_i}\right)
\end{equation*}
is a vector of mutually independent random variables on $[0,1]$. Let $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ be nonnegative independent random variables in $[0, 1]$ then $R$ can be defined as
\begin{equation*}
R = \left(1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\right)
\end{equation*}
and 
\begin{equation}\label{increments_v}
\begin{split}
\left(1, \frac{X_2}{X_1 + X_2}, \ldots, \frac{X_j}{\sum_{i=1}^j X_i}, \ldots, \frac{X_k}{\sum_{i=1}^k X_i}\right) =_d \left(1, V_2, \ldots,V_j, \ldots, V_k\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $=_d$ indicates equality in distribution a.s. From \Cref{increments_v} it is possible to derive the distribution of $X$ in terms of $V = (V_1, \ldots, V_k)$ as an "inverse" stick-breaking process like in \cite{bloem2017preferential}.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
(X_1, X_2, \ldots,X_j, \ldots X_k) &=_d \left(\prod_{i=2}^k(1-V_i), V_2\prod_{i=3}^k(1-V_i), \ldots, V_j\prod_{i=j+1}^k(1-V_i), \ldots, V_k\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where we set $V_1 = 1$.

The increments in \Cref{increments_v} can be written equivalently in terms of a random distribution function $F$ corresponding to a random probability $P$ such that $F(t) = P([-\infty, t]) \in [0, 1]$ for $t \in \bbR_{+}$. The random distribution function is a stochastic process that satisfies

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $F$ is a.s. non-decreasing
	\item $\lim_{t \rightarrow - \infty} F(t) = 0$ a.s., $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} F(t) = 1$ a.s, and
	\item $\lim_{s \rightarrow t^+} F(s) = F(t)$ for each $t \in \bbR_{+}$
\end{enumerate}
as stated in \cite{doksum1974tailfree}.

The increments in \Cref{increments_v} can be rewritten in terms of the stochastic process $F$ as

\begin{equation}\label{increments_NTL_F}
\left(\frac{F(t_1)}{F(t_1)}, \frac{F(t_2) - F(t_1)}{F(t_2)}, \ldots, \frac{F(t_k) - F(t_{k-1})}{F(t_{k})} \right) =_d \left(1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\right)
\end{equation}
for $0 < t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_k < \infty$. The random distribution $F$ is essentially a random cumulative density function (CDF) and its stochastic process corresponds to a special type of Levy process called \textit{subordinator} \cite{orbanz2012lecture}. 

\paragraph{Levy process} \cite{papapantoleon2008introduction} A stochastic process $Z = \{Z(t) : t \in \bbR_+\}$ is said to be a Levy process if it satisfies the following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $Z(0) = 0$
		\item For any $0 < t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_k < \infty$, $Z(t_2) - Z(t_1), \ldots, Z(t_k) - Z(t_{k-1})$ are independent.
		\item For any $s < t$, $Z(t) - Z(s) =_d Z(t-s)$
		\item For any $\epsilon> 0$ and $t \in \bbR_{+}$, $\lim_{s \rightarrow t}P( |Z(t)-Z(s) > \epsilon|) = 0$
	\end{enumerate}

Given the correspondence between the random CDF and a Levy process, we can find a function of a Levy process, $Z$, such that the random distribution $F$ satisfies the NTL properties. The need to express $F$ as a function of $Z$ is motivated by the fact that working with a Levy process simplifies some derivations. In Theorem 1 we define $F$ as a function of a Levy process for NTL process, the analogous of Theorem 1 for NTR processes can be found in \cite{doksum1974tailfree}.

\paragraph{Theorem 1} $F_{t_k}(t)$ is a random distribution function neutral-to-the-left if and only if it has the same probability distribution as
\begin{equation}\label{NTL_eq}
\exp(Z(t) - Z(t_k)), \quad t \in (0, t_k]
\end{equation}
for some Levy process $Z$.

\textit{Proof:} We start by proving that by writing $F_{t_k}$ as in \Cref{NTL_eq} we obtain independent increments. For any increment $I[t_{j-1}, t_j]$ of a NTL process,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\frac{F_{t_k}(t_j) - F_{t_k}(t_{j-1})}{F(t_j)} = 1 - \frac{F_{t_k}(t_{j-1})}{F_{t_k}(t_j)} = 1 - \exp\left(-(Z(t_j) - Z(t_{j-1}))\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
since increments of a Levy process are independent, it follows that increments of a NTL generated by \Cref{NTL_eq} are independent. 

We now show that the process, $Z(t)$, following from the definition of $F$ has independent increments, hence proving it is a Levy process. We first write a general expression for $F_{t_k}(t_j)$ derived from \Cref{increments_NTL_F}. First note that
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
&\frac{F_{t_k}(t_k) - F_{t_k}(t_{k-1})}{F_{t_k}(t_{k})} = V_k \implies F_{t_k}(t_{k-1}) = (1-V_k)
\end{split}
\end{equation*} 
recursively we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{NTL_F}
F_{t_k}(t_j) = \prod_{i=j+1}^k (1 - V_i)
\end{equation}

The increments of the stochastic process $Z(t)$ can be written as 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Z(t_j) - Z(t_{j-1}) &= \log(F_{t_k}(t_j)) - \log(F_{t_k}(t_{j-1}))  = \log\left(\frac{F_{t_k}(t_{j})}{F_{t_k}(t_{j-1})}\right) \\ &= \log\left(\frac{\prod_{i=2}^{j-1} (1 - V_i)}{\prod_{i=2}^{j} (1 - V_i)}\right) = -\log(1 - V_j)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
hence showing that the increment at time $t_j$ only depends on a function of $V_j$ and since $V_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, k$ are independent, the increments of $Z(t)$ are independent. This shows that $Z(t)$ is a Levy process. $\qed$

Note that it is important to define $F$ on a specific interval to ensure it represents a proper CDF. However, a fixed time interval is by no mean restrictive and the results derived in the following hold for any time interval. In fact, the random CDF in \Cref{NTL_eq} can be normalized to any interval as
\begin{equation*}
F_{t_k}(t) = \frac{F_{t_{k-1}}}{\exp(Z(t_k) - Z(t_{k-1}))} \quad t \in (0, t_k]
\end{equation*}

The definition of $F$ is therefore valid for any time interval. Hence, to simplify notation in the rest of the analysis we omit the subscript of $F$ unless necessary.

\subsection{Cumulative birth measure}\label{CBM}

For the analysis of NTR processes \cite{james2006poisson} defines the cumulative hazard measure $\Lambda$, which directly relates to the NTR increments, and bases his analysis on this object, similarly to \cite{hjort1990nonparametric}. In order to analyse NTL processes we define the cumulative birth measure 
\begin{equation}\label{birth_measure}
B(ds) = F_{t_k}(ds)/F_{t_k}(s+), \quad s \in \bbR_+
\end{equation}
where $ds = s+ - s-$ and $F_{t_k}(s+) = P(T \leq s+)$ with $T \in \bbR_+$. $B$ is a completely random measure. Interestingly, defining the cumulative birth measure as in \Cref{birth_measure} lets us relate random jumps in the Levy process $Z$ to random jumps in $B$ in exactly the same way as done in \cite{james2006poisson} for $Z$ and $\Lambda$. A random jump $J_j$ in $B$ taking values in $[0,1]$ corresponds to a random jump $-\log(1 - J_j)$ in $Z$ taking values in $\bbR_+$ (\textbf{Note to self: Include proof in final version. Equate B to J}).

Furthermore, we can write
\begin{equation*}
P(T \in ds | F_{t_k}) = F_{tk}(ds) = B(ds)F_{t_k}(s+) = B(ds)\exp(Z(s+) - Z(t_k))
\end{equation*}

Lastly, to address the issues above, \cite{james2006poisson} used results from Poisson partition calculus \cite{james2005poisson}. Although the results from Poisson calculus come from a previous work \cite{james2005poisson}, the approach greatly simplified proofs and allows for a relatively simple generalization of NTR processes. Approaches used in literature prior to this work derived sampling distributions for Dirichlet processes using combinatorial arguments \cite{antoniak1974mixtures,pitman2002combinatorial}. Adopting a similar strategy in generalizing NTR processes would result challenging and would likely not be viable. 

goes beyond deriving a posterior characterization for the SPNTR. In fact, James' work was motivated by a different observation and  


Since numerous contributions were made by \cite{james2006poisson}

Neutral-to-the-right (NTR) stochastic processes \cite{doksum1974tailfree} were introduced as priors for Bayesian nonparametrics models of right censored data (e.g survival analysis). In Bayesian statistics, using priors specifically designed for the problem at hand is renowned to be beneficial for effective inference. Hence, having the possibility to improve the descriptiveness of models for right censored data using NTR priors should be seen as a great advantage.
