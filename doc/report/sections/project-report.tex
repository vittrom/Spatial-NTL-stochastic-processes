Lastly, to address the issues above, \cite{james2006poisson} used results from Poisson partition calculus \cite{james2005poisson}. Although the results from Poisson calculus come from a previous work \cite{james2005poisson}, the approach greatly simplified proofs and allows for a relatively simple generalization of NTR processes. Approaches used in literature prior to this work derived sampling distributions for Dirichlet processes using combinatorial arguments \cite{antoniak1974mixtures,pitman2002combinatorial}. Adopting a similar strategy in generalizing NTR processes would result challenging and would likely not be viable. 

goes beyond deriving a posterior characterization for the SPNTR. In fact, James' work was motivated by a different observation and  


Since numerous contributions were made by \cite{james2006poisson}

Neutral-to-the-right (NTR) stochastic processes \cite{doksum1974tailfree} were introduced as priors for Bayesian nonparametrics models of right censored data (e.g survival analysis). In Bayesian statistics, using priors specifically designed for the problem at hand is renowned to be beneficial for effective inference. Hence, having the possibility to improve the descriptiveness of models for right censored data using NTR priors should be seen as a great advantage.
